# miniLaTeX

To test MiniLaTeX Parser, first run `sh bench.sh` at the root of this folder.
A new document, `bench.html` will be created.  Open
this document in a broswer.

The tests are the same as reported on Slack, adn the test document
is taken from one on the app: http://www.knode.io/#@public/423 

The files of interest are in `./src/LatexParser`.
Please see `./src/LatexParser/LatexParser.adoc`
for moe information.

NOTE. In the tests, the most important line is

  `benchmark1 "formatDocument" LatexParser.Paragraph.formatDocument qftIntroText`
  
The function `formatDocument` results in this sequence of calls:

  -> formatParagraphList
  -> formatParagraph
  -> Render.transformText

Thus `transformText` is exercised paragraph by paragraph on the full document qftIntroText.
